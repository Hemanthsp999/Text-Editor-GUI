# Text-Editor-GUI
This is a basic text editor created with the Tkinter library in Python.
It provides a user-friendly interface for entering and editing text. 
The editor allows users to type characters using their keyboard, and the characters are displayed in a text input field. 
The cursor indicates the current position in the text. 
Users can move the cursor left or right using the arrow keys, and they can delete characters using the backspace key. 
The text is stored internally as a linked list, where each character is represented by a node. 
Inserting a character adds a new node at the cursor position, while deleting a character removes the node at the cursor position. 
The editor provides a simple yet functional way to interactively edit text.
